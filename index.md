## Note: this workshop is still in development.

Moving beyond basic commands, this hands-on, interactive workshop will help you understand the grammar of shell commands, and will show you how to use shell tools to quickly search through and manipulate large data sets, create advanced pipelines using composable Unix commands, and even view images and listen to music right from the command-line.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Break down complex workflows into manageable components
2. Identify the most appropriate command-line tool for each step
3. Become more at home in the terminal as an everyday workspace

## Requirements

Participants will need access to a Bash shell environment and some experience with basic shell usage. If you are using the zsh shell, for example, please make sure that you are able to access Bash as well. In addition, the following programs will be used during the workshop, and should be installed in advance if not already present on your system:

- curl
- wget
- mc
- mplayer
- ffmpeg
- imagemagick

If possible, these should be installed using the package manager on your system (e.g., using `apt`, `yum`, etc. on Linux, or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on MacOS. Windows users will need to use Cygwin or, if you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can install packages using `apt` as in regular Ubuntu (see instructions [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL#Installing_Packages_on_Ubuntu)).

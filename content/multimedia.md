# Working with multimedia

The command-line is not just about text -- you can work with multimedia in the terminal too. Whether batch processing images, audio, or video, or listening to music, even watching videos, a surprising amount can be done directly in the console.

Basic multimedia editing and conversion tools:

- Images: `imagemagick` (which provides the versatile `convert` command)
- Video: `ffmpeg` for converting, editing, and extracting video
- Audio: `sox` (the "Swiss Army Knife of audio processing programs)

For playing back multimedia there are a large number of options depending on your preferences, for example:

- `mplayer` basic command for playing movies and audio
- `mocp` or `moc` an interactive visual console-based audio player
- `mpv` a command line video player
- `cmus` a small and fast console music player

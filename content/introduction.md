# Introduction

This session builds on the basic shell skills particpants have gained either on their own or through our [intro-shell]() workshop. In this workshop we will be covering shell customization, online help, workflow analysis, and working with data and multimedia files directly in the terminal.

Generally speaking, during the workshop we will be working hands-on with a single tool or command for each area. Other tools may be mentioned in passing or demonstrated for reference and can be found on the [Resources](../resources.md) page.

Of course, it is not possible to cover everything shell-related in one session. More specifically, some major areas we will _not_ be covering in this workshop (but may include in future offerings) are:

* Server provisioning
* Bash scripting
* Arrays
* SSH
* Termux
* Comparing strings
* Emacs, vim, and other editors

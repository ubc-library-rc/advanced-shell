# Breaking down workflows

Everyone tends to use the command-line in different ways depending on their personal needs and preferences. Since there are so many different commands, options, and possibilities in the Unix shell, it doesn't make much sense to try and memorize them all. Instead, try to think about your own personal workflow and what kinds of tasks you tend to spend the most time on -- particularly those that would benefit from automation, batch processing, or just ease of typing.

For example, do you:

1. Spend most of your time in a web browser accessing information online?
2. Work with large amounts of data in spreadsheets or corpora?
3. Work mostly with images, audio, or video?
4. Something else?
